          Photography for me is about noticingâ€”about paying attention to the way
          time, movement, and perception shape what we see. Sound is an
          important part of this. I am looking for both the effects of sound on
          photographs as well as the sound that photographs express. I think I
          can hear the lines on the road and the reflection in that glass; see
          the barely audible vibration of the docked ferry and the distant hum
          of that building.

          I am drawn to unplanned abstraction, finding it in reflections,
          layered views through windows, unintended geometry, and the shapes
          that humans carve in space. Chance and self-imposed procedural
          constraints usually play a role. I like ceding some control to time,
          random numbers and maps. These constraints push me off the beaten
          path. Photographs want to be uncertain - to ask questions, not answer
          them.

          I make photographs in black and white, working within the limits of an
          analog process. An antidote to a digital nine to five and the usual
          megapixel chasing. The process is physical, from loading the camera to
          developing to printing in the darkroom. This tactile, hands-on
          connection with the machines and the film keeps me engaged with the
          process while allowing me to create something personal and momentary.

          Photography is my way of noticingâ€”about paying deliberate attention to
          the way time, movement, and perception shape what we see. Sound is an
          important part of this. I am looking for both the effects of sound on
          photographs as well as the sound that photographs express. I think I
          can hear the lines on the road and the reflection in that glass; see
          the barely audible vibration of the docked ferry and the distant hum
          of that building.

          I am drawn to unplanned abstraction, finding it in reflections,
          layered views through windows, unintended geometry, and the shapes
          that humans carve in space. Chance and self-imposed procedural
          constraints usually play a role. I like ceding some control to time,
          random numbers and maps. These constraints push me off the beaten
          path. Photographs want to be uncertain - to ask questions, not answer
          them.

          I work in black and white, embracing the limitations of analog
          processes. This approach serves as a counterbalance to digital
          immersion and the pursuit of technical perfection. The process is
          physical, from loading the camera to developing to printing in the
          darkroom. This tactile, hands-on connection with the machines and the
          film keeps me engaged with the process while allowing me to create
          something personal and momentary.
